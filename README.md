## How To Build
Follow these directions to setup SDL: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/index.php

The basic steps are:
1. Download appropriate development version of SDL
2. Create an empty project in IDE (if desired)
3. Add SDL include directory to include path
4. Add SDL lib directy to library path
5. Add SDL2.lib and SDL2main.lib to linker
6. Put SDL2.dll (or equivalent) in build output directory

## How To Run
SDL2.dll (or other OS equivalent) should be in the same directory as the executable. Then, run the executable generated from the build.
